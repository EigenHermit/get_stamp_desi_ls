# get_stamp_desi_ls
This repository provided a program that can download the images (both fits and png) from DESI-LS.                       
The make_H22_fits.ipynb enables you to download the fits or png stamp in H22 catalogue (He+ 2023).          
Other wanted targets can be downloaded if you replace H22.csv with your own csv.                    
Obviously, the csv must contains ra,dec.
